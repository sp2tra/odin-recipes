<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Super quick and easy - you will probably have all the ingredients in your 
    pantry already! Serve with your favorite sauce! I served mine with spicy mayo, 
    made by mixing 3 tablespoons mayo with 1/2 tablespoon sriracha. It would also 
    be great with tzatziki or spicy mustard.
